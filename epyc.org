** Release planning

*** Release 1.5.2

**** Coding

***** DONE Command-line interface to lab notebooks

      Allow notebooks to be manipulated from the command line. Specifically
      this is to copy and delete result sets from notebooks to tidy them up
      for release.

      Also need to be able to :

      - Manipulate attributes of result sets
      - Add [[*Notes for result sets][notes for result sets]] for later annotation

***** DONE Select or create

      Add a select-or-create method to LabNotebook that can be used as a
      guard for either loading or executing a block of code, to let
      experiments only run when needed.

***** TODO Notes for result sets

      Add notes alongside results, as well as the description field.

***** TODO Tidier handling of HDF5 (and other) files

      Not creating files without good reason; handling missing file by
      failing rather than creating.

***** TODO Allow functions in lab parameters

      As well as constants and lists, allow a function that gets
      called for a value.

***** DONE Alternative experimental designs

      Cross-product of parameter space (as now); adding explicit
      combinations of parameters; maybe others?

***** TODO Rename SingletonDesign to PointwiseDesign


**** Bugs

***** TODO Empty array typing

      In HDF5, adding an empty array first into a field means that the
      result set doesn't get typed properly, as there's no element type
      known.

**** Documentation

***** DONE Jupyter conditional use case

      Document using LabNotebook.already() for load-or-execute cells.

***** DONE ParallelLab uses sub-processes

      Because each experiment in a ParallelLab runs in a sub-process,
      it runs in a different address space to the parent and sop can't
      affect the variables in the main process -- for example to write
      into a shared or class variable. The solution is to always pass
      results out in results dicts, which then get copied about
      correctly.

***** TODO JOSS paper
      DEADLINE: <2021-09-10 Fri>


** Sub-projects

*** Experimental designs

    Add a method for describing experimental designs. These would
    essentially structure the parameter space of an experiment in a
    Lab to (for example) only execute a select number of
    possibilities, rather than doing the whole cross product blindly.

    Might help with load balancing too.

*** Container-based engines

    Support running experiments in the cloud by containerising the
    engines.
