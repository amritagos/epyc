Cookbook
========

This section is a work-in-progress cookbook of using ``epyc`` in practice.

.. note::

    In this cookbook we assume you're using either Linux or OS X (or some other Unix variant).
    We don't venture into Windows, as it's less used for (and less convenient for) scientific
    computing.
