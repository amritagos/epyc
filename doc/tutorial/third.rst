Third tutorial: Larger notebooks
================================

So far we've generated fairly modest datasets from experiments. That can rapidly
change if you start running lots of repetitions of an experiment, and if you
want to collect the results of *different* (but related) experiments within
the *same* notebook, and to share these datasets with others or make use of tools
other than ``epyc`` and your own analytics code to study them. For these reasons
to need to be able to handle larger-scale datasets.
